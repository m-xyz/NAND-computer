# NAND-computer

Someone told me that a computer can be built with just NAND logical gates.<br>
The NAND Boolean function has the property of function completeness, meaning that [any other Boolean expression can be re-expressed by an equivalent expression using only NAND gates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic)
